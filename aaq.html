                <p>We would like to ensure that your garage door is fully and properly balanced before attempting more troubleshooting. Here is how we can do that:</a></p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>1.	Close your garage door fully and unlock the carriage from the rail by pulling the emergency release cord. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>2.	Lift the door up and down to get the feel of it: does the door move smoothly? </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>3.	Lift the door to about 3-4 ft above the ground and release. Do not let go of the door if it feels like it will drop to the floor hard. Does the door stay in place or move up or down? If it moves up or down, by how much? </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>4.	Once you have finished, you can close the door fully. Do not forget to reengage the carriage once you are finished. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>Please let me know how the door behaves during this process. You can respond to this email or call in at (800) 354-3643, Monday-Friday from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. EST. </p>

     <p>Good morning,</p>
                <p>I would like to try resetting your limits. Your door will have a ‘down/close limit’ and an ‘up/open limit’. These limits tell the door where to stop when its opening or closing, which makes sure the door doesn’t run into the ground or the powerhead on your ceiling. If these limits aren’t working properly, they can cause damage to your door and opener, or problematic movement in either direction! Please follow the steps below:</p>
                <p>You will want to start with your door in the open or partially open position and engaged to the opener (make sure the red cord has not been pulled; if so, engage the carriage back into the bullet/turnbuckle on the chain or belt before proceeding).</p>
		<p><b>DOWN LIMIT:</b></p>
		<p>1.	On the belly of the powerhead on the ceiling, you should see two triangles and one square button. Press and hold the down triangle button (-) until the long LED comes on blue; release the button, and the LED will begin to flash blue.</p>
		<p>2.	Press and hold the down triangle button (-) to close the garage door. When the door lightly touches the ground, release the button. To adjust the position, you can press either the up triangle (+) or the down triangle (-).  </p>
		<p>3.	When the door is at the correct position, press and release the square button once to set the position. Both LEDs should flash blue then go out.</p>
                <p><b>UP LIMIT:</b></p>
                <p>1.	Press and hold the up triangle button (+) until the long LED comes on blue; release the button, and the LED will begin to flash blue. </p>
                <p>2.	Press and hold the up triangle (+) to open the garage door. When the door is all the way open (do not allow it to hit the powerhead), release. To adjust the position, you can press either the up triangle (+) or the down triangle (-).  </p>
                <p>3.	When the door is at the correct position, press and release the square button once to set the position. Both LEDs should flash blue then go out. </p>
                <p><b>Please do not skip this step:</b> After you reset the limits, you’ll have to set the force of your door. This is a necessary step to finish this process. </p>
                <p>1.	Go to the wall console: press and release the button on the wall to fully close the garage door. </p>
                <p>2.	Once the door is fully closed, press and release the button on the wall again to open the door all the way.</p>
                <p>Your limits should be set properly now! If you continue to have issues, you can try these steps again or you can call us at (800) 354-3643, Monday-Friday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM EST. You can also respond to this email with any questions you have!</p>

                <p>Good morning, </p>
<p>I’d like to try some troubleshooting to see if we can get the lights on your unit to turn off properly. Please follow the steps below:
<p><b>AT THE WALL:</b></p>
<p>1. Remove the wall button from the wall. </P>
<P>2. Remove the wires from behind the wall button, making sure to keep them separated for now. </P>
<p>3. Touch the two ends of wire to each other; the unit should run. </p>
<p>4. Wait 4-6 minutes for the light cycle to end and the lights to turn off. </p>
<p>If the light turns off, then you’ll unfortunately need to replace the wall button. If the light stays on, continue following the next steps. </p>
<p><b>AT THE UNIT:</b></p>
<p>1. Follow the wall button wires up to the terminals on the power head.</p>
<p>2. Remove the wall button wiring from terminals 3 and 4.</p>
<p>3. Run the operator with a wireless remote or keypad. </p>
<p>4. Wait 4-6 minutes for the light cycle to end and the lights to turn off. </p>
<p>If the light turns off, then you’ll need to replace the wiring on the wall button.If the light stays on, please contact us via responding to this email or calling in. Our phone number is (800) 354-3643, and we’re open weekdays from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. EST.</p>

<span id="toggle-arrow8">▼</span>

<div id="toggle-content8" class="toggle-content8">
<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>The red safety beam blinking 3 times usually indicates either interference from another set of beams or sunlight interference. Do you have sunlight shining on the green beam? If so, this is causing the issue. You can determine this for sure by blocking sunlight from the green beam and seeing if the red beam goes solid. </p>
<p>If the sun is hitting the safety beams, usually the easiest way to correct this is to the swap the positions of the safety beams. Move the red one to where the green one is, and vice versa. The wires can stay the same. If the sun is hitting both sides, then you can move the safety beams back farther into the garage, but they will need to stay at the same height. If this does not solve the issue, or if you’re unable to switch the positions, you can cover the green beam with a small paper towel or toilet paper roll. Make sure not to block the sensor from the red beam. </p>
<p>Please let me know how the red LED responds to these steps. You can respond to this email or call us at (800) 354-3643 any weekday from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. EST.</p>

<div id="toggle-content9" class="toggle-content9">
<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>If you've determined that the sunlight is not interfering with the safety beams, it’s likely that another set of beams or other appliances nearby is the cause of the issue. If you have multiple garage doors, I’ve attached a diagram of the correct safety beam setup. If they need swapped, just remove the wires from the beam sensors, unscrew the beam brackets from the wall, switch sides, and reconnect/reattach. </P>
<P>If you only have the single door, try removing any appliances in the garage that may be interfering. This could include kitchen appliances, power tools, etc. Remove them one at a time and check the safety beams to see if the red beam LED continues blinking or goes solid. </P>

<p>Good morning, </p>
<p>I would like to try some troubleshooting to see if we can get the safety beam LEDs back on.</p>
<p>Let's start at the safety beams: do you have a 9-volt battery? If so, please remove the wires from the back of the safety beams and touch the battery to the terminal. Does the beam light up? If not, then the beams are bad. </p>
<p>If it does light up, then let's move on to checking the wire going from the beam to the powerhead on the ceiling. Please check for any damage to the wire, make sure it is tight and secure on both the terminals on the beam and the powerhead. If the wire looks damaged then that is your issue, if not then it could be the terminals on the powerhead. </p>

<p>Good morning, </p>
<p>I’d like to try some troubleshooting to see if we can get your safety beams back to normal. </p>
<p>Two blinks on the red safety beam indicates either that the two beams aren’t fully aligned or that something’s obstructing the sensors. Let’s check to make sure that the beams didn’t get bumped and are facing towards each other at an equal height, and check there’s nothing blocking them from seeing each other. Also, please wipe off the eyes (sensors) on the safety beams, as any dust or spider webs can cause interference with the beams. Next, please check the two wires that go into the beams to make sure that they are on the terminals tightly. Then, go to power head on the ceiling and check that the wires are attached properly there as well. </p>

<p>Please let me know how the safety beams respond to these steps by responding to this email or calling us at (800) 354-3643 any weekday from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. EST.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
